        <h2>The Brave Warrior of the Hungarian Revolution</h2>
        <img src="/weboldal/kepek/Turul.png" alt="Picture of Péter Turul">
        <p>Péter Turul, the legendary warrior of the 1848 revolution, was one of the most determined defenders of Hungarian freedom. Raised in the forests of Bakony, he lived and fought for liberty from a young age. Legends tell that he could take down an Austrian cavalryman with a single sword strike and that he healed his battle wounds with pálinka.</p>
        <p>When the War of Independence broke out, he immediately joined the Hungarian Honvéd Army, where his bravery and cunning military tactics quickly earned him the recognition of Lajos Kossuth. Along with his comrades, he defended the fortress of Komárom against the Austrian siege and always fought on the front lines of the battlefield.</p>
        <p>According to legend, on one occasion when he was surrounded by the enemy, he threw his homemade kolbász at the Austrian commander, surprising them so much that he managed to break through the encirclement. Péter Turul's name lives on in the hearts of Hungarians as an eternal symbol of freedom and courage.</p>
